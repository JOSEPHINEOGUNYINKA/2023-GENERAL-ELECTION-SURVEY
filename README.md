## Introduction
The last 8 years have been a rollercoaster of feelings and emotions for Nigerians, in which they are helpless and hopeless due to the situation of the country, which has negatively impacted all sectors, including the economy, security, individuals, families, and businesses. The course was mostly blamed on the present administration of government, and the majority could hardly wait for the exchange of political offices from the present administration to the people they think are more competent and understand the concerns of the masses more.

The presidential election in Nigeria holds every 4 years, which is at the end of a tenure. The 2023 general election was stated to hold on the 25th of May 2023, which is why the analysis was done at the time.

## Probles Statement
The analysis was conducted to check the political willingness and readiness of Nigerians for the 2023 election exercise.

## Data Sourcing
Data was sourced by creating a Google Form containing the necessary information needed for the survey and sharing it with contacts. The link to the form was uploaded on social media, and some influencers were engaged to help in the sharing and broadcast of the form. WhatsApp also became a very useful tool for publicity. The link to the form was sent as a broadcast message to contacts that were asked to fill it out and share their status with friends, families, and acquaintances.

## Data transformation
The data was transformed using a power query in Microsoft Excel, while the analysis was done using Microsoft Excel.

## CONCLUSION
The analysis shows that 76% of the people that participated in the survey are willing to vote, while 24% won’t be voting due to reasons such as no Permanent Voters Card (PVC), distance to their polling unit, and personal unwillingness to vote. This is impressive and notable as the majority usually feel less concern about the election and the outcomes in the previous years.
